**Hello, my name is Michael.**  

I canâ€™t stand an ugly and incorrect code so much that at the slightest glance at it my whole body
is covered with convulsions and an unshakable desire to fix everythingðŸ˜±.
**This is my main advantage and disadvantage at the same time. I spend a lot of time on detailsðŸ•˜.**   

I believe that every programmer developing an open source project should treat coding as an artðŸŽ¨.  

Code is no doubt a tool for making money, but code is your face too.
